# Flutter Sound V6.x is OUT

Please refer to the [CHANGELOG.md file](https://dooboolab.github.io/flutter_sound/book/CHANGELOG.html) to get learn all the great new features. It has especially the following :

## Flutter Web support

Flutter Sound is supported by Flutter Web. You can play with [this live demo on the web](https://dooboolab.github.io/flutter_sound/doc/flutter_sound/web) (still cannot record with Safari or any web browser on iOS). You can [read this](https://dooboolab.github.io/flutter_sound/book/flutter_sound/codec.html#flutter-sound-on-flutter-web).

## Record to Dart Stream

This feature has been requested from many months from many, many, many Flutter Sound users. This open doors to things like feeding a Speech-to-Text engine.

You can refer to the [Getting Started with Record-to-Stream](https://dooboolab.github.io/flutter_sound/book/flutter_sound/codec.html#recording-pcm-16-to-a-dart-stream) notice.

## Playback from a live Dart Stream

This feature has also been requested from many months from many Flutter Sound users.

You can refer to the [Getting Started with Playback-from-Stream](https://dooboolab.github.io/flutter_sound/book/flutter_sound/codec.html#playing-pcm-16-from-a-dart-stream) notice.

## Help Maintenance

My friend Hyo has been maintaining quite many repos these days and he is burning out slowly. If you could help him cheer up, buy him a cup of coffee will make his life really happy and get much energy out of it. As a side effect, we will know that Flutter Sound is important for you, that you appreciate our job and that you can show it with a little money.
