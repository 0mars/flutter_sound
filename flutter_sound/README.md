## Overview

Flutter Sound is a Flutter package allowing you to play and record audio for :
- Android
- iOS
- Flutter Web

Maybe, one day, we will be supported by Linux, Macos, and even (why not) Windows. But this is not top of our priorities.

Flutter Sound provides both a high level API and widgets for:

* play audio
* record audio

Flutter Sound can be used to play a beep from an asset all the way up to implementing a complete media player.

The API is designed so you can use the supplied widgets or roll your own.

- Flutter Sound requires an iOS 10.0 SDK (or later)
- Flutter Sound requires an Android API level 21 (or later)

## Features

The Flutter Sound package includes the following features

- Play and Record flutter sound or music with various codecs.
- Play local or remote files specified by their URL.
- Play assets.
- Play audio using the built in SoundPlayerUI Widget.
- Roll your own UI utilising the Flutter Sound api.
- Record audio using the builtin SoundRecorderUI Widget.
- Roll your own Recording UI utilising the Flutter Sound api.
- Support for releasing/resuming resources when the app pauses/resumes.
- Record to a Dart Stream
- Playback from a Dart Stream
- The App playback can be controled from the device lock screen or from an Apple watch

## Help

&tau; is a fundamental building block needed by almost every mobile project.

I'm looking to make &tau; the go to project for Audio with support for each of the Flutter supported platforms and for React Native.

&tau; is a large and complex project which requires me to maintain multiple hardware platforms and test environments.

I greatly appreciate any contributions to the project which can be as simple as providing feedback on the API or documentation.


## Thanks

Too many projects to manage. I am burning out slowly. If you could help me cheer up, buy me a cup of coffee will make my life really happy and get much energy out of it. As a side effect, we will know that Flutter Sound is important for you, that you appreciate our job and that you can show it with a little money.
