# The &tau; (tau) Project


The &tau; project is a set of libraries which deal with audio :

- A player for audio playback
- A recorder for recording audio
- Several utilities to handle audio files

&tau; is a big project. The goal is to share a maximum of the developments between various Platforms/Frameworks and various target OS.

## Features

- Play and Record sounds or music with various codecs. (See [the supported codecs here](flutter_sound/codec.html#flutter-sound-codecs))
- Play local or remote files specified by their URL.
- Record to a live stream Stream
- Playback from a live Stream
- The App playback can be controled from the device lock screen or from an Apple watch

## Supported platforms

&tau; is actually supported by the following frameworks:
- Flutter (Flutter Sound)

In the future, it will be (perhaps) supported by
- React Native (Tau RN).  (Not yet. Later).
- Cordova (Tau Cordova).  (Not yet. Later).
- Others (Native Script, Solar 2D, ...)


## Supported targets

&tau; is actually supported by the following OS :

- iOS
- Android
- Web

In the future, it will be (perhaps) supported by
- Linux
- others (Windows, MacOS)


## What about Flutter Sound ?

Flutter Sound is not dead, of course. This is exactly the opposite. 
Flutter Sound is a really alive project.

We just changed the name of the project, because we want to encompass others frameworks than Flutter.
