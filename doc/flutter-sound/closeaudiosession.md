## closeAudioSession method

 [Future](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/dart-async/Future-class.html)&lt;void&gt; closeAudioSession \(\)

Close an open session.

Must be called when finished with a Player, to release all the resources. It is safe to call this procedure at any time.

* If the Player is not open, this verb will do nothing
* If the Player is currently in play or pause mode, it will be stopped before.

example:

```text
@override
void dispose()
{
        if (myPlayer != null)
        {
            myPlayer.closeAudioSession();
            myPlayer = null;
        }
        super.dispose();
}
```

### Implementation

```text
Future<void> closeAudioSession() async {
  print('FS:---> closeAudioSession ');
  await _lock.synchronized(() async {
    if (_isInited == Initialized.notInitialized) {
      return this;
    }
    // probably better not to throw an exception here
    //if (isInited == Initialized.initializationInProgress) {
    //throw (_InitializationInProgress());
    //}

    _isInited = Initialized.initializationInProgress;
    await _stop();

    //_removePlayerCallback(); // playerController is closed by this function
    var state =
        await FlutterSoundPlayerPlatform.instance.releaseMediaPlayer(this);
    _playerState = PlayerState.values[state];
    _removePlayerCallback();
    FlutterSoundPlayerPlatform.instance.closeSession(this);
    _isInited = Initialized.notInitialized;
  });
  print('FS:<--- closeAudioSession ');
}
```
