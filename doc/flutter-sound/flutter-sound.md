Flutter Sound is the first \(and actually the only\) implementation of the τ Project. This Flutter plugin is supported by :

* iOS
* Android
* Flutter Web

Maybe, one day, we will be supported by Linux, Macos, and even \(why not\) Windows. But this is not top of our priorities.

### Flutter Sound branches

We actually maintain two branches for Flutter Sound :

* The V5 branch \(the version ^5.0.0\)
* The master branch \(actually the version ^6.0.0\)

### SDK requirements

* Flutter Sound requires an iOS 10.0 SDK \(or later\)
* Flutter Sound requires an Android 21 \(or later\)

### Examples \(Demo Apps\)

Flutter Sound comes with several Demo/Examples :

Please refer to [README](example/) to have a preview of those examples. [The `examples App`](https://github.com/canardoux/tau/blob/master/flutter_sound/example/lib/main.dart) is a driver which can call all the various examples.
