## Creating the `Recorder` instance.


This is the first thing to do, if you want to deal with recording. The instanciation of a new recorder does not do many thing. You are safe if you put this instanciation inside a global or instance variable initialization.

*Example:*
```dart
myPlayer = FlutterSoundRecorder();
```
