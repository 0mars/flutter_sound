## `startPlayerFromMic()`

- Dart API: [startPlayerFromMic()](pages/flutter-sound/api/player/FlutterSoundPlayer/startPlayerFromMic.html).

Starts the Microphone and plays what is recorded.

The Speaker is directely linked to the Microphone.
There is no processing between the Microphone and the Speaker.

{% include tip.html content="If you want to process the data before playing them, actually you must define a loop between a FlutterSoundPlayer and a FlutterSoundRecorder.
(Please, look to [this example](flutter_sound_examples_stream_loop.html))." %}


startPlayerFromMic() has two optional parameters :
- `sampleRate:` the Sample Rate used. Optional. Only used on Android. The default value is probably a good choice and the App can ommit this optional parameter.
- `numChannels:` 1 for monophony, 2 for stereophony. Optional. Actually only monophony is implemented.

startPlayerFromMic() returns a Future, which is completed when the Player is really started.

{% include note.html content="Several Ï„ users needs to play on the headset what is recorded by the microphone, in quasi-real-time.
I am convinced that implementing audio-graph will be the general solution and will be very elegant.
But I think that we can implement this new simple verb `startPlayerFromMic()` before the great global solution.

Later, we will implement the _Tau Audio Graph_ concept, which will be a more general object." %}
